# OrientationAssitant

Orientation Assistant is an interactive application for Students and Faculty Members of NUST.

Freshmen can use this app to find others with matching interests, to get information about NUST and to simply find stuff to do around NUST 

Sophomores and Faculty can create events and invite freshmen to the events.
